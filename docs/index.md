# Transport for London Cycling Data

Exploratory Data Analysis of the Transport for London (TfL) Cycling trip data.

## Overview

The main goal is to apply the knowledge acquired during the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) course, while keeping it simple enough to fit in the plaintext format of a github repository.

I will analyze a single year worth of data, to limit the scope of the analysis.

I will work with the data from 2024 since is the most recent complete year at the time of writing.

## Tools

I will be working mainly with:

| Tool                                   | Use                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)          | Parse, clean and query the dataset |
| [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)     | General purpose diagrams           |
| [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) | Complex plots                      |
